IQ-Block

I've got an IQ Block from great gizmos for christmas. My shapse are a bit different to other peoples. So far the only one i've found that's the same as mine is
in here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djz_tBJ0o8w


Basic idea is to find as many combinations of the included shapes to fit together to make a perfect square.

I'm not coding this atm for public uses so the notes and such are all meant for me.

I've come up with a method of storing the shapes in their order (roughly recoded in the notes file) and 
a php script to draw it out. once i get this completely down i'll just brute force all the possible 
combinations and get out a nice list of all solutions to the puzzle.


rename colours.orig.php to colours.php (and move the one that's there to something else) for the original set of colours/shapes that
is seen in the youtube video

the current colours.php uses shapes from http://www.prismenfernglas.de/iqblock_e.htm
	Unfortunately as they use 10 shapes, having 2 digit outputs for the character slots stops it lining up right so i made it output the letter X 
	colourised however the colours aren't that easy to tell apart


RUN: php drawTest.php in terminal

note: there's probably duplicates as you could rotate everything 90 degrees 3 times.
