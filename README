IQ-Block

I've got an IQ Block from great gizmos for christmas. My shapse are a bit different to other peoples. So far the only one i've found that's the same as mine is

Basic idea is to find as many combinations of the included shapes to fit together to make a perfect square.

I'm not coding this atm for public uses so the notes and such are all meant for me.

I've come up with a method of storing the shapes in their order (roughly recoded in the notes file) and 
a php script to draw it out. once i get this completely down i'll just brute force all the possible 
combinations and get out a nice list of all solutions to the puzzle.
