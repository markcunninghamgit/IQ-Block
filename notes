= Colours =
yellow
pink
orange
dark purple
light purple
light green
dark green
blue

how to express formation:

order of colours
order of rotation. First blank spot indicates what block you're describing
black spots are taken from left-> right thentop-> bottom. 
(ie, we go down the whole left line first, then go back to the top and take the second line down)


Colour default rotations + side
rotates start like this as 1. they go up to 3 by clockwise rotation
side 1 or 2

the point we draw from is the one that would be hit first.
Given the rotation, we take the very left left lane and take the top
block from that lane

42 different possible shape positions/flips etc

42^8 (9682651996416) maximum possible combinations

technically it's less... it's 42*(some reduced value)* etc. where we take away each possible shape combinations. i'm too lazy to write that out

advantage of being as soon as a shape doesn't fit, we can skip all other combinations of shapes in other positions.
