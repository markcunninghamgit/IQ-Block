how to express formation:

order of colours
order of rotation. First blank spot indicates what block you're describing
black spots are taken from top-> bottom then left to right. 
(ie, we go down the whole left line first, then go back to the top and take the second line down)


Colour default rotations + side
rotates start like this as 1. they go up to 3 by clockwise rotation
side 1 or 2

the point we draw from is the one that would be hit first.
Given the rotation, we take the very left left lane and take the top
block from that lane
